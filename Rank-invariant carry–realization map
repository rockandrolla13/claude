The correct first visualization: Rank-invariant carry–realization map
Core idea

You want to test monotonicity, not magnitude.

So you visualize:

Expected carry → as a rank or standardized score

Realized excess return → normalized by horizon volatility or carry scale

This answers:

Is higher expected carry → higher realized outcome?

Without relying on portfolio sizing, leverage, or scale?

1️⃣ Primary plot: Quantile monotonicity plot (gold standard)
What to plot

X-axis: Expected carry rank (e.g. deciles or ventiles)

Y-axis: Mean realized excess return (or t-stat) over horizon

Each point is:

“Bonds in carry quantile q → average realized outcome”

Why this is invariant

Ranks eliminate scale

No portfolio weights

No leverage

No distributional assumptions

Interpretation

Upward sloping → carry has alpha content

Flat → no signal

Non-monotone / hump-shaped → selection bias or execution effects

Downward → carry is misleading (reject)

Reviewer-safe framing

“We evaluate whether ex-ante carry induces a monotone ordering of realized outcomes.”

📍 This should be your Figure 1.

2️⃣ Normalize the Y-axis properly (critical)

You have two correct choices. Pick one and lock it.

Option A (preferred): Carry-scaled return

Interpretation:

1.0 → realized matches expectation

<0 → carry misleading

1 → conservative carry estimate

This is dimensionless and intuitive.

Option B: t-stat per bucket

Interpretation:

Scale-free

Very reviewer-friendly

3️⃣ What NOT to do (important)

Do not plot:

Expected carry vs realized levels

Scatter with raw values (heteroskedastic, misleading)

Portfolio PnL

Cumulative curves

Those all bake in scale choices you explicitly want to avoid.

4️⃣ Optional but powerful: Calibration plot

This is your second diagnostic.

Plot

X-axis: Expected carry (rank-normalized)

Y-axis: Realized carry component only (not total return)

Add:

45° reference line

Interpretation:

Slope ≈ 1 → well-calibrated carry

Slope < 1 → decay / slippage

Slope > 1 → conservative model

This directly supports your:

“carry explains ≥ 40% of return” criterion

5️⃣ One plot that kills most objections (if you want to be surgical)
Rank IC over time

Compute Spearman rank correlation between expected carry and realized return per rebalance

Plot distribution (boxplot or histogram)

Why it’s lethal:

Scale-free

No portfolio construction

No distributional assumptions

Time-local (no look-ahead accusations)

If median IC > 0 and stable → alpha exists.

6️⃣ How to label it (words matter)

Use language like:

“Monotone ordering test”

“Rank-based validation”

“Scale-free diagnostic”

“Execution-aware realized returns”

Avoid:

“Performance”

“Profitability”

“Strategy returns”

7️⃣ Where this lives in your repo
reports/
└── diagnostics/
    ├── carry_quantile_monotonicity.png   ← FIRST FIGURE
    ├── carry_calibration.png
    └── rank_ic_distribution.png

8️⃣ One-sentence takeaway to remember

Alpha at this stage is monotonicity, not money.

If expected carry doesn’t order realized outcomes without scale, the strategy is dead before portfolio construction even enters the room.

If you want, next I can:

write the exact plotting code (pandas + matplotlib, no seaborn)

help you choose between carry-scaled return vs t-stat

or help you phrase the JFDS-style caption that preempts reviewer attacks
