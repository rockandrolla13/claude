Where multi-model helps most
1) Better “Think First” (pre-Plan Mode)

Use ChatGPT/Gemini before Claude Code to produce a sharper plan:

ChatGPT: strongest at structured reasoning, checklists, tradeoff tables, “what am I missing?”, and turning vague goals into constraints.

Gemini: often strong at broad exploration, alternative approaches, and (depending on your setup) handling multi-modal inputs; also good at generating multiple options quickly.

Upgrade: Do “triangulation planning”

Ask ChatGPT for a plan + risks + minimal architecture

Ask Gemini for alternative architecture + edge cases

Merge into a single plan.md you feed to Claude Code for implementation

This reduces Claude’s tendency to invent structure.

2) Higher quality CLAUDE.md

Claude.md is a policy + conventions file. Multi-model improves it:

Use ChatGPT to draft rules with rationale (“why”) and to remove fluff.

Use Gemini to find “missing constraints” and “implicit assumptions” based on your repo conventions.

Upgrade: Add a maintenance loop

Whenever Claude deviates, paste the diff + your correction into ChatGPT and ask:
“Turn this into a single crisp rule for CLAUDE.md (include why, keep it short).”

3) Context window / degradation management (big win)

Models drift when context bloats; the tutorial recommends /compact and /clear. Multi-model can make the reset cleaner:

Upgrade: Use ChatGPT/Gemini as an external summarizer

At any point, export:

current plan

key decisions

current errors / failing tests

“what we tried”

Ask ChatGPT to produce a “handoff packet”:

STATE.md (what’s true now)

NEXT.md (next actions)

RISKS.md (known traps)

Then start a fresh Claude Code session and point it at these files.

Result: you reset context without losing engineering rigor.

4) Catching Claude’s failure modes faster

Claude gets stuck in loops; another model can diagnose the loop without inheriting it.

Upgrade: “Second model reviewer” pattern

When Claude loops:

copy the last 30–80 lines of terminal output + the current hypothesis

ask ChatGPT: “What are the 3 most likely root causes and the next 3 tests?”

Then feed those tests back to Claude Code.

You’re basically forcing a fresh independent prior.

5) Prompt engineering becomes reusable assets

You can have ChatGPT/Gemini produce your reusable .claude/commands/* prompts:

/debug_minimal.md

/refactor_small.md

/review_pr.md

/design_doc.md

Claude executes them; ChatGPT/Gemini refine them.

Where multi-model usually does not help (or backfires)
1) Implementation ping-pong

If multiple models are generating code directly, you get:

inconsistent style

mismatched abstractions

duplicated or contradictory changes

Rule: one model writes code in the repo (Claude Code). Others plan/review/summarize.

2) Over-architecture from “too many opinions”

Triangulation is good, but you must converge:

pick one architecture

write it to plan.md

stop asking for more options

3) Conflicting instructions

If ChatGPT says “keep it minimal” and Gemini says “use a framework,” Claude will do both poorly.

Fix: consolidate into a single “source of truth” plan + CLAUDE.md.

A practical enhanced workflow (what I’d actually do)

Phase A — Design (ChatGPT/Gemini)

ChatGPT: “Write a minimal architecture + constraints + acceptance tests.”

Gemini: “Give 2 alternative designs + edge cases + failure modes.”

You: choose. Merge into plan.md.

Phase B — Implement (Claude Code)
4) Claude reads CLAUDE.md + plan.md and implements.
5) Hooks run formatting + typecheck/tests.

Phase C — Review (ChatGPT)
6) Paste diff + test output: “Review for overengineering, missing tests, and invariants.”
7) Convert feedback to a short patch list → give to Claude.

Phase D — Reset (when context degrades)
8) ChatGPT produces a clean STATE/NEXT/RISKS packet.
9) New Claude session continues.

If you want one thing to add immediately

Add three files at repo root and keep them tiny:

plan.md (architecture + steps)

SCRATCHPAD.md (current attempt + logs + hypotheses)

STATE.md (what works, what fails, how to run tests)

Use ChatGPT/Gemini to keep those crisp; use Claude to execute.
