Here’s the **actionable, do-this checklist** distilled from the full Claude Code tutorial. No philosophy, just execution.

---

## 1. Before You Touch Claude (Mandatory)

* **Write a plan first** (5–10 min).

  * What are you building?
  * What exists already?
  * What is the *end state*?
  * Constraints (performance, simplicity, deadlines).
* Use **Plan Mode** (Shift + Tab twice) before any real work.
* If unsure, **co-design the plan with an LLM** first, then execute in Claude Code.

---

## 2. Always Specify Architecture (Even for Small Tasks)

Instead of:

> “Build an auth system”

Do:

* Data models involved
* Storage choices
* Lifetimes / TTLs
* Boundaries (routes, folders, files)
* Explicit scope

**Rule:** If you didn’t define structure, Claude will invent one (badly).

---

## 3. Set Up `CLAUDE.md` Properly (High Leverage)

Create a short `CLAUDE.md` at repo root.

**Include only:**

* Project-specific conventions
* Non-obvious commands
* Architectural constraints
* “Why” behind rules

**Hard limits:**

* Keep it short (≲150 instructions total)
* No generic docs
* No tutorials

**Maintenance loop:**

* If you correct Claude twice → add it to `CLAUDE.md`
* Press `#` while working to update it automatically

---

## 4. Manage Context Aggressively

Context degrades at **~30–40%**, not 100%.

**Rules:**

* One conversation = one feature/task
* Never mix unrelated work
* Write plans to files (`plan.md`, `SCRATCHPAD.md`)
* Keep those files at repo root

**Reset protocol (use often):**

1. Copy key info
2. `/compact`
3. `/clear`
4. Paste back only essentials

---

## 5. Prompt Like an Engineer

Every prompt should include:

* **What to do**
* **What NOT to do**
* **Why it matters**

Example:

> “Keep this minimal. No new abstractions. One file only. This runs on every request so prioritize speed over flexibility.”

**Golden rules:**

* Specific > vague
* Constraints > freedom
* Examples > descriptions

---

## 6. Pick the Right Model for the Job

* **Opus** → planning, architecture, tradeoffs
* **Sonnet** → execution, refactors, boilerplate

**Workflow:**

1. Plan with Opus
2. Implement with Sonnet
3. Same `CLAUDE.md` = clean handoff

---

## 7. Use Tools (But Don’t Go Crazy)

Try these incrementally:

* **MCP** → eliminate copy/paste (GitHub, DBs, APIs)
* **Hooks** → auto-format, type-check, lint after edits
* **Slash commands** → reusable prompts (`/review`, `/debug`, `/deploy`)

If you repeat a task → automate it.

---

## 8. When Claude Gets Stuck

Do **not** keep pushing.

Instead:

* `/clear` and restart
* Reduce scope
* Provide a minimal example
* Reframe the problem (e.g. state machine vs logic flow)

**Rule:** If you explained something 3 times, change strategy.

---

## 9. Build Systems, Not One-Offs

* Use headless mode (`-p`) for automation
* Script Claude into CI, PR review, docs, logs
* Log outputs
* Improve `CLAUDE.md` based on failures

**Flywheel:**
Claude mistake → fix rules/tools → Claude improves → repeat

---

## 10. Mental Model to Internalize

* Claude is **stateless**
* Output quality = input quality
* Bad results = unclear thinking, not bad models

---

### One-Sentence Operating Rule

> **Think → Plan → Constrain → Execute → Reset early → Automate what repeats**

If you want, I can turn this into:

* a **one-page checklist**
* a **default `CLAUDE.md` template**
* or a **Claude Code workflow you can drop into Cursor / terminal**
