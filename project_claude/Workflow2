# Data Availability Checker

## User Inputs
| Parameter | Example | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| Rating | IG, HY, BBB, BB+ | Single or range |
| Duration | [3,5], [5,7] | Years |
| Coupon | [0,5], [5,8] | Percentage, optional |
| Min bonds | 50 | Minimum universe size |
| Desired period | 2Y, 5Y | Target length |

## Workflow
1. Filter reference data by rating, duration, coupon
2. Check pricing data coverage for filtered universe
3. Check TRACE data coverage for filtered universe
4. Compute intersection: longest continuous period where all sources adequate
5. Generate feasibility report with recommendations

## Output
- `reports/data_availability_{timestamp}.md` — summary report
- `reports/data_availability_{timestamp}.csv` — monthly breakdown

## Interactive
If insufficient, suggest relaxations:
- Broader rating range
- Wider duration bucket
- Remove coupon filter
